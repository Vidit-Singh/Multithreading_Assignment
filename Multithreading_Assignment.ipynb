This is particularly beneficial in applications where multiple operations can be performed simultaneously, such as handling multiple client requests in a server application.\n",
    "- Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of user interfaces and applications by allowing time-consuming tasks to be performed in the background without blocking the main thread. This helps prevent the user interface from becoming unresponsive or freezing during resource-intensive operations.\n",
    "- Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share resources such as memory space, files, and network connections, leading to more efficient resource utilization. This can result in reduced overhead compared to running multiple independent processes.\n",
    "- Simplified Design: Multithreading can simplify the design of complex applications by allowing developers to organize tasks as separate threads of execution within a single process. This can lead to cleaner and more modular code, making it easier to manage and maintain the application.\n",

This can result in bottlenecks that limit the effectiveness of multithreading.\n",
